Cross-Chain Governance
Project Description
Create a cross-chain DAO that facilitates governance between different blockchains. The goal is to bridge the gap between siloed blockchain ecosystems by enabling governance-related interactions and decisions across chains.

Project Vision
The vision of this project is to establish a unified governance platform that enables decentralized decision-making across multiple blockchain networks. By supporting cross-chain governance, the platform aims to foster collaboration, interoperability, and decentralization at a larger scale.

Future Scope
Interoperability Enhancements: Integration with major cross-chain protocols (e.g., Polkadot, Cosmos, LayerZero).
Token-based Voting: Implement voting mechanisms utilizing native or bridged tokens.
Governance Automation: Smart contract automation for decision enforcement across chains.
User Interface: Develop a front-end DApp for easier governance participation and tracking.
Security Audits: Conduct formal verification and third-party audits to ensure security.
Key Features
Chain Approval Management: Add or remove approved chains for cross-chain governance participation.
Owner-Only Access: Restrict critical functions to the contract owner for security.
Event Emission: Emit events on chain approval/revocation for transparency.
Cross-Chain Ready: Designed as a foundational component for future cross-chain interaction logic.
